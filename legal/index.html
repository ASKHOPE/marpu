            Dear Esteemed Board Members, It is with profound gratitude and a
            sense of responsibility that I address you today, reflecting on the
            journey of MARPU over the past three years. These years have been
            marked by both challenges and triumphs, as we remained steadfast in
            our commitment to serving the marginalized and underprivileged
            communities. As we navigate through this annual report, I invite you
            to join us in celebrating our achievements and reaAirming our
            dedication to creating positive change.

          <h3>Organizational Overview</h3>
          <p>
            MARPU, founded in 1995 by Mr. Yalakapalli Yerrappa, has been a
            beacon of hope for marginalized communities, particularly focusing
            on the Dalit population. Since its inception, MARPU has expanded its
            reach to encompass multiple districts in Andhra Pradesh and
            Karnataka, striving to address the multifaceted needs of the most
            vulnerable segments of society.
          </p>
          <h3>Transition of Leadership</h3>
